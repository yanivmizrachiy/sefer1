# GitHub-First Workflow

This project follows a **GitHub-first** development model where the repository is the single source of truth.

## Core Principles

- **GitHub repository is the single source of truth** - All project state lives in the repository
- **Do not rely on local-only state** - Never assume local files, environment variables, or uncommitted changes exist
- **Every meaningful change must be committed** - All code changes, configuration updates, and documentation modifications should be committed to git
- **If it is not committed, it does not exist** - Uncommitted work is considered temporary and may be lost
- **Multi-device workflow** - This project is opened from multiple devices; always ensure changes are pushed to GitHub
- **Preserve repository consistency** - Maintain reproducibility and consistency across all environments

## Workflow Requirements

1. **Always commit meaningful changes** - After making code changes, commit them with clear messages
2. **Push to GitHub regularly** - Don't leave commits only in local repository
3. **Never assume local state** - Don't rely on:
   - Uncommitted files
   - Local environment variables not in the repo
   - Local-only configuration
   - Files in `.gitignore` unless explicitly documented
4. **Document dependencies** - All dependencies and setup requirements must be in the repository (package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, etc.)
5. **Version control everything** - Configuration files, scripts, and documentation should be tracked

## When Making Changes

- ✅ Commit changes immediately after completing a feature or fix
- ✅ Push commits to GitHub to ensure they're available on all devices
- ✅ Include clear commit messages describing what changed and why
- ❌ Don't leave uncommitted work "for later"
- ❌ Don't rely on local-only files or state
- ❌ Don't assume others (or other devices) have access to uncommitted changes

## Automatic Push Workflow

After committing changes, **always push to GitHub immediately**:

1. **Check for unpushed commits**: `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`
2. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin HEAD:main` (or current branch)
3. **Verify push succeeded**: Check that commits appear in `git log origin/main`

### Troubleshooting Push Issues

If push fails due to proxy/network issues:
- Disable proxy for GitHub: `git config --global http.https://github.com.proxy ""`
- Verify connection: `git ls-remote --heads origin`
- Retry push until successful

**Never consider work complete until it's pushed to GitHub.**
